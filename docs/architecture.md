## Technical Overview

### 1. Architecture Overview
Flashcards App will use a **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture**, dividing the system into three primary layers: **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, and **Data Access**. This structure ensures a clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Presentation Layer**: 
  - **Responsibilities**: Manages the user interface and handles user interactions.
  - **Technologies**: Built with React for component-based structure and mobile-first design. Tailwind CSS will be used for responsive styling, ensuring a visually cohesive experience across devices. The application will be configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to support offline access and a mobile-app-like experience.
  
- **Business Logic Layer**:
  - **Responsibilities**: Processes document uploads, handles text summarization, and generates flashcards using NLP services. This layer also manages application-specific rules and workflows, such as user session management and role-based access control (RBAC).
  - **Technologies**: Node.js with Express is used to build a RESTful API, handling all client requests and routing them to appropriate services.
  - **NLP Integration**: Python-based NLP services (spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers) are used for document parsing and summarization, transforming text data into flashcard content.

- **Data Access Layer**:
  - **Responsibilities**: Manages all database interactions and file storage, handling user data, document metadata, and generated flashcards.
  - **Technologies**: MongoDB for storing structured data like user information, flashcards, and metadata. AWS S3 is used for document storage, providing secure and scalable cloud storage for uploaded files.

### 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React**: For building a responsive, interactive user interface.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating a mobile-first, responsive layout.
  - **PWA**: The frontend will be configured as a Progressive Web App to provide offline support and mobile compatibility.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js with Express**: Provides a RESTful API for handling client requests, managing user sessions, and routing data between layers.
  - **Python (NLP Services)**: Used with libraries like spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers for text processing, summarization, and flashcard generation.

- **Database and Storage**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows flexible data storage, well-suited for storing JSON-like documents, user data, and flashcards.
  - **AWS S3**: Secure storage for uploaded documents, allowing for easy scaling as file storage needs grow.

- **Authentication and Security**:
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Token-based authentication to ensure secure user sessions.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures secure access by restricting permissions for different user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user).

### 3. Integration Considerations

- **Frontend and Backend Communication**:
  - The frontend will communicate with the backend via a RESTful API, with endpoints for user authentication, document upload, and flashcard generation. JSON will be the primary data format for all requests and responses.

- **Data Handling and Transformation**:
  - **File Uploads**: The backend will handle document uploads using Node.js libraries (e.g., Multer) to verify file type and size. Uploaded files are stored in AWS S3, and the backend will parse these files using Python NLP services to generate flashcard content.
  - **Data Flow**: Data from the document is extracted, processed, and stored in MongoDB. Generated flashcards are then accessible from the frontend for users to view or download.

- **External Services and APIs**:
  - **AWS S3**: Integrated for secure, scalable document storage, with S3 buckets configured for access control and backup.
  - **Python NLP Services**: The backend will integrate spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers to handle text processing, extract keywords, and generate summarized flashcard content from uploaded documents.

### 4. Security and Compliance

- **Data Security**:
  - Data in transit will be encrypted using HTTPS to ensure secure data exchange.
  - Sensitive information, such as user authentication tokens, will be encrypted and securely stored.

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - **JWT** is used for secure, token-based authentication, ensuring that user sessions are protected.
  - **RBAC** enforces access control, granting specific permissions to different user roles.

- **Error Handling and Logging**:
  - Centralized error handling will be implemented on both frontend and backend to capture and log any issues.
  - Logging tools (e.g., Winston for Node.js) will be used to track errors and monitor system health.

### 5. Scalability and Performance Optimization

- **Horizontal Scalability**:
  - Both MongoDB and AWS S3 offer horizontal scalability, allowing us to easily handle growth in data storage needs.
  - The backend (Node.js) can also be scaled horizontally using load balancers to manage increased traffic.

- **Performance Optimization**:
  - **Caching**: In-memory caching (e.g., Redis) may be used in the future to reduce database queries for frequently accessed data.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: Processes such as document parsing and flashcard generation will run asynchronously to avoid blocking user interactions.

- **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
  - Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) will be used to track system performance and detect any issues in real-time.
  - Scheduled maintenance and backups for MongoDB and AWS S3 will ensure data reliability and availability.
